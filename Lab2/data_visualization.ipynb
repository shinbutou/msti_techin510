    "Next you will iterate over the data to count how many steps were taken. There are alternative ways to do that but here we will outline an approximation of the \"zero-crossing\" method. Walking with an accelerometer results in cyclic patterns characterized by pairs of peaks and valleys in acceleration in some directions. In the provided data you can focus on the z dimension, since the mobile device was held in fixed orientation. To determine the peaks and valleys, iterate over the z values; compare each element in the list to the value of the previous and the next element (note that you cannot do this for the first and last elements of the list); if it is greater than or smaller than both of those, it corresponds to a peak or a valley. Create a separate list, of same length as the data lists, that has the value +1 where peaks occur, -1 where valleys occur, and 0 otherwise. Visualize the peaks and the valleys on the same plot as your data to verify that your algorithm works correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that even very small variations in acceleration cause peaks and valleys, so we need to be stricter in detecting peaks and valleys that correspond to an actual step. For that, you can extend the condition for peaks and valleys to include a threshold on the absolute value (`math.fabs()`) of the acceleration in the z direction (e.g., ~1m/sec^2). Visually inspect the number of peaks and valleys with this stricter criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "A rough approximation of the number of steps would be the `math.min()` of the numbers of peaks and number of valleys. If you are out of time for this lab, you can stop here. However, to count pairs of peaks and valleys more strictly, you need to iterate over the list of peaks and valleys to determine the number of times a peak is followed by a valley (or vice versa) within one second or so (i.e., -1 and 1 separated by no more than four 0s in the peak/valley list). So if you have time, implement counting of pairs as a more accurate approximation of the number of steps. \n",
